# Important: OpenAI API Key Configuration

## Current Status

The OpenAI API key has been configured in the `.env` file. However, please note:

**⚠️ The provided API key does NOT have access to embedding models.**

The key only has access to text generation models (GPT-4, etc.) but not to embedding models like:
- `text-embedding-3-small` 
- `text-embedding-ada-002`

## Required Action

To use this MCP Vector Server, you need an OpenAI API key with embedding model access. Please:

1. Get an API key with embedding permissions from OpenAI
2. Update the `.env` file with the new key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_embedding_enabled_api_key_here
   ```

## Testing Your API Key

You can test if your API key has embedding access by running:

```javascript
const { OpenAI } = require('openai');
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

const response = await openai.embeddings.create({
  model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
  input: 'test',
});
```

If you receive a 403 error mentioning model access, your key doesn't have embedding permissions.
